# Building an AI Agent from Scratch

This project documents the process of building an AI agent from the ground up using Node.js and a large language model (LLM) API. The goal is to understand agent fundamentals—prompting, tool usage, memory, and control flow—without relying on high-level agent frameworks.

This is a **learning-focused, terminal-first project** intended to explore how AI agents actually work under the hood.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand the core components of an AI agent
- Build agent behavior incrementally from first principles
- Work directly with an LLM API rather than abstracted libraries
- Explore how agents reason, respond, and take action
- Practice structuring AI-powered systems in code

---

## 🧠 What This Agent Does

At its current stage, the agent:

- Accepts user input from the terminal
- Sends structured prompts to an LLM
- Receives and parses model responses
- Demonstrates basic reasoning loops and responses
- Serves as a foundation for future tool usage and memory

This project is intentionally **minimal and transparent**, prioritizing understanding over features.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **JavaScript / TypeScript**
- **OpenAI-compatible LLM API**
- **Terminal-based execution**

No frontend or UI layer is included—interaction happens entirely via the command line.
